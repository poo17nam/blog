Hi and welcome! I'm Poonam, software developer by profession who's still learning to be a better developer. I write my views and opinions on technologies, places, food, etc on this blog.

In the cooking department, I'm a food enthusiast with an appetite for almost anything. I like to try out unique and interesting dishes.

You can also reach me on IRC: \_poonam_ on irc.freenode.net
